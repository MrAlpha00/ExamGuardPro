You are fixing and improving an existing deployed project called ExamGuardPro.
Do NOT remove or overwrite any existing working code or logic.
Only add the missing features and fix specific issues described below.

---
### ✅ CURRENT STATE
The project is deployed on Render and most core features work:
- Admin login, hall ticket generation, student login, QR authentication, exam start, and submission.
- Database and build commands are correct.
But after the last agent run, the exam auto-submits immediately and admin functions disappeared.

---
### 🧩 FIX THESE ISSUES

1. **Exam Auto-Submit Bug**
   - When student taps "Start Exam", it should not auto-submit immediately.
   - Fix the exam-start logic so the exam begins normally and only submits when:
     - Timer runs out, OR
     - Student leaves fullscreen, OR
     - Admin flags student, OR
     - Student manually submits.

2. **Hall Ticket Handling**
   - Keep the working behavior where used hall tickets move to “Bin” after submission.
   - Prevent multiple logins for the same hall ticket.

3. **Admin Features Missing**
   - Restore all admin panel pages (Active Students, Incident Management, Alerts, Results, etc.).
   - All buttons, lists, and live camera views must work again.

4. **Add New Feature — ID Card Barcode Verification**
   - In Admin Panel → While generating hall ticket → add a new input field:
     “Attach Student ID Barcode” (store this value in the database).
   - In Student Identity Verification → add “Scan College ID Barcode” option.
   - Use the device camera to scan the barcode using a JS library (choose `quaggaJS`, `html5-qrcode`, or `jsQR`).
   - When student scans, validate that the scanned barcode matches the one stored by admin.
   - If match → continue to live capture → then start exam.
   - If mismatch → show error “Invalid ID verification”.

5. **Exam Timer & Incident Monitoring**
   - Re-enable timer and ensure exam auto-submits when time ends.
   - Incident Management must record and display live incidents.

### ⚙️ RULES
- Don’t delete or rename working routes, components, or database schemas.
- Only append or reconnect missing functions.
- Test that deployment still builds with same commands and runs correctly.
- Output must include all fixed/added code and explain what was changed.

GOAL: Keep all existing features working, fix the auto-submit bug, restore admin panel, and add the barcode ID verification system.
